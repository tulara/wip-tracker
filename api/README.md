## To run
```
node index.js
```
Note this will not watch for changes.  
By default the apollo server runs on port 4000. Opening `http://localhost:4000/` will open a GraphQL Playground over the API.

## To do
[ ] Add watcher for js changes to avoid having to keep restarting the server
[ ] Retrieve projects from database
[ ] Find out why I can't seem to use ES6 module syntax even though I'm running node 12.
